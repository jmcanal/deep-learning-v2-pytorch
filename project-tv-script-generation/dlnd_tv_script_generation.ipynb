    "**Answer:** This was a bit difficult, because I initially started with embedding and hidden dimension size that were much too large. I was also using a batch size that was too small, so my training was quite slow. I looked at the mentor help for parameter suggestions and ended up reducing my embedding and hidden dimension sizes. I was surprised at how small the embeddings dimensions should be. Also, I started with a sequence length of 10 because the text is usually short, but reduced that even further to 8. I kept my n_layers for the LSTM at 2 because in the course 2-3 is usually optimal. I started with a learning rate of 0.001 and increased it slightly to 0.005, which seemed to help. Lastly, I initially tried to train for only 5 epochs which was not enough. I increased training to 30 epochs in order to reach the target loss value below 3.5."

    "### Generate Text\n",
    "To generate the text, the network needs to start with a single word and repeat its predictions until it reaches a set length. You'll be using the `generate` function to do this. It takes a word id to start with, `prime_id`, and generates a set length of text, `predict_len`. Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!"
